### I am a junior Data Analystüìä, passionate about technology, with more than 6 years in sales and retail, I define myself as a disciplined person in search of continuous improvement.


I have a professional carrer as a Telecommunications and IT professional.
After more than 6 years in the world of customer service and retail, I decided to prepare myself to be the best Data professional I can be.

There's nothing special about me, I'm just deeply curious and that means I always find a solution.
